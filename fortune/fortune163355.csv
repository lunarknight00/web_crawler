"    戴尔公司(Dell)特别委员会今天上午公布了一份投资者陈述,其中自然少不了对个人电脑市场的冷嘲热讽,同时还解释了为什么股东在情况进一步恶化前闪人才是明智之举.下个月,戴尔公司的股东就将对公司创始人迈克尔•戴尔和私募股权投资公司银湖(Silver Lake)发出的245亿美元收购要约进行投票.","    Dell Inc.'s special committee this morning published an investor presentation ahead of next month's shareholder vote on a $24.5 billion buyout offer from company founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake. Included were several requisite barbs at the personal computer market, and why shareholders would be smart to bail before things get even worse."
    上图是该陈述中的与此内容相关的一页幻灯片.,    Here is one of the relevant pages from its presentation.
"    我们可以看到,其中大部分数据都来自调研公司IDC.这家公司在今年4月发布报告称,2012年一季度至2013年一季度期间,全球个人电脑发货量下降了13.9%,引发轩然大波(不知何故,戴尔的特别委员会似乎把此数字向下取整了一下).","    As you can see, most of the data is from research firm IDC, which made waves in April by reporting that global PC shipments fell 13.9% between Q1 2012 and Q1 2013 (seems Dell's special committee rounded that down, for some reason)."
"    然而,相比之下鲜为人知的是,IDC随后又发布报告称,2013年整年预期仅会下跌7.9%.此外,这家调研公司还预计,到2017年全球个人电脑出货量将略有增加.","    What got far less attention, however, was that IDC subsequently reported that the entire 2013 forecast was for only a 7.9% dip. Moreover, it projected a slight increase in shipments by 2017."
"    今天,高德纳(Gartner)发布了类似的调研结果,报告称今年一季度全球个人电脑出货量下降了11.2%.高德纳目前预测2013年全年降幅为10.6%.","    And we got something similar today from Gartner, which had reported an 11.2% Q1 decline. Now Gartner says that the overall 2013 drop should be 10.6%."
"    如果IDC和高德纳预测准确,那么个人电脑销量下降的趋势实际上有所缓和.这倒不至于使戴尔放弃它的服务器或服务业务而重新专注于个人电脑业务,但也不至于像4月份的数据最初给人的感觉那样,让人觉得情况只会越来越糟,完全没有盼头.或许这是卡尔•伊坎尚未认输的原因之一.","    If IDC and Gartner are correct, then the downward trajectory of PC sales actually is flattening out a little bit. Not so much as to make Dell (DELL) scrap its server or services businesses and refocus on PCs, but also not the ""If you thought this quarter was bad, wait until next quarter"" mentality that the April numbers at first seemed to imply. Maybe that's one reason why Carl Icahn hasn't thrown in the towel yet..."
