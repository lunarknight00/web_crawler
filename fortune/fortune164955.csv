"    自2001年发布首款Xbox设备以来,微软(Microsoft,<财富>500强(Fortune 500))一直在为争夺游戏玩家而与索尼(Sony)和任天堂(Nintendo)展开激烈竞争.2005年,Xbox 360的发布使这家以软件起家的游戏主机制造商从不被市场看好变成如今的主要市场参与者之一.自产品发布以来,微软在全球已售出超过7,700万台Xbox 360,与索尼PlayStation 3至今的销量(7,700万台)基本持平.[在当前一代游戏主机销量中,任天堂(Nintendo)独占鳌头,在全球共售出超过1亿台Wii.]","    Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) has been battling against Sony (SNE) and Nintendo(NTDOF) for gamers' attention since the original Xbox launched in 2001. The software giant-turned-console-manufacturer evolved from underdog to major player with the Xbox 360 in 2005. Microsoft has sold over 77 million Xbox 360s globally since launch, which is neck-and-neck with Sony's 77 million PlayStation 3s sold to date. (Nintendo is in the lead for current generation console sales with over 100 million Wiis sold worldwide.)"
"    而对于即将在11月上市的Xbox One(售价500美元),按照游戏玩家的观点,微软还有许多工作要做.对于限制二手游戏,取消游戏租赁和阻止玩家离线玩游戏等颇具争议的功能,公司突然改变了态度.微软还有足够的时间来赢得游戏玩家和更多主流消费者的""芳心"".微软在Xbox One发布会上重点介绍了下一代游戏主机所具备的新娱乐功能,以此来吸引主流消费者.下面是微软必将在游戏主机大战中获胜的五条理由:","    Microsoft has a lot of work to do in the court of gamers' opinions when it comes to the Xbox One, which launches in November for $500. The company has flip-flopped with its controversial features that would have limited used game playback, eliminated game rentals and prevented gamers from playing games offline. There's still plenty of time to win over gamers and the more mainstream consumers that Microsoft courted at its Xbox One reveal with its focus on the new entertainment features the next generation console opens up. Here are five reasons Microsoft will win the console war."
<光晕>游戏,Halo
"    这款来自美国著名电子游戏软件制作室Bungie的第一人称射击游戏在全球已经售出超过5,000万份.后来向游戏开发工作室343 Industries的过渡也非常顺利,去年<光晕4>(Halo 4)(见上图)在一周内的销售额就达到了3亿美元.微软将在2014年推出Xbox One版的<光晕>游戏,而史蒂夫•斯皮尔伯格将根据科幻小说,为Xbox Live拍摄一部<光晕>电视剧.这款游戏就是所谓的""杀手级应用"",不仅Xbox的死忠粉丝,就连主流玩家也会愿意掏钱购买一台新主机.","    This first-person shooter from Bungie has sold over 50 million copies worldwide. The transition to developer 343 Industries has been smooth with Halo 4 (shown above) selling $300 million worth of games in one week last year. Microsoft has its first Xbox One Halo game coming in 2014 and Steven Spielberg is developing a live action Halo TV series for Xbox Live based on the sci-fi franchise. This is the type of ""killer app"" that both hardcore and more mainstream gamers will invest in a new console for."
体感游戏机Kinect,Kinect
"    Kinect作为Xbox 360的一款扩展设备共售出了2,500多万台,引领了""无控制器""进行游戏的潮流.Kinect 2将内置在Xbox One主机当中(因此,它的定价比PS4高出100美元,PS4摄像头单独购买的价格为60美元).这种捆绑销售非常重要,因为这样一来,发行商和开发商便会更容易支持设备,而Xbox 360在这方面一直比较欠缺.此外,对于新款Kinect的娱乐功能,微软也有宏大的计划.新Kinect将能够跟踪,识别多位家庭成员的面部和表情,甚至可以监测心率.","    Microsoft has sold over 25 million Kinects as an add-on for the Xbox 360, ushering in ""controller-less"" engagement with games. Kinect 2 will come packed inside every Xbox One (hence the extra $100 price point over the PS4, which will sell its PS4 Camera separately for $60). This bundle is important as publishers and developers will be more apt to support the device, something that has been lacking on the 360. Microsoft also has big plans for the entertainment functionality of the new and improved Kinect, which can recognize and track multiple family members' faces and expressions and even gauge your heart rate."
