"    星巴克(Starbucks)正在美国一些城市积极推广由废旧海运集装箱改造而成的""得来速""门店,而最新的一站则是盐湖城.上图这个面积386平方英尺的零售店计划于周一开业.",    Salt Lake City is the latest addition to the growing list of cities with a Starbucks drive-through constructed out of old shipping containers. The 386-square-foot store pictured here is scheduled to open today.
"    据<财富>杂志(Fortune)5月份报道,这种集装箱咖啡店模式源于星巴克进一步推广得来速门店的计划.这家咖啡连锁店公司未来5年计划新开1,500家店铺,其中大约900家(60%)将是这种""驾车驶入""咖啡店.预计这些店有相当一部分将由海运集装箱改造而成.","    As Fortune reported in May, the container-as-coffee shop model is part of Starbucks' push further into drive-throughs. About 900, or 60%, of the 1,500 new U.S. stores that the coffee company has planned for the next five years will be drive-throughs. Expect a good portion of those to be made from shipping containers."
"    建筑中使用海运集装箱并不新奇,但星巴克投身其中,表明使用集装箱作为建筑单元已经发展到了一个新的层面.","    There's nothing new about using shipping containers in construction, but the fact that Starbucks (SBUX, Fortune 500) has gotten into the game signals that the use of the container as a building block has reached a new level."
"    ""集装箱不再是一时的流行,""SG Blocks董事长兼CEO保罗•高尔文表示.""它已成为一种主流建筑材料.""","    ""The container is no longer a fad,"" says SG Blocks (SGBX) chairman and CEO Paul Galvin. ""It's a mainstream instrument of construction."""
"    高尔文的公司是星巴克这一计划的合作伙伴之一,它的全部业务就是改造旧集装箱用于建筑.高尔文表示,他正在听到越来越多像星巴克这样的蓝筹公司对使用海运集装箱感兴趣.此举的环保意义很具吸引力,把这些退役集装箱用于建筑,能将它们从废弃物中拯救出来.",    Galvin's company is one of Starbucks' partners on the endeavor and has made a whole business out of repurposing old containers for construction. Galvin says he's hearing more and more from blue-chip companies like Starbucks who are interested in using shipping containers. The fact that they're green is a big draw-using the retired containers for construction takes them out of the waste stream.
"    另外,SG Blocks正在纽约57号码头实施一个项目,计划将456个海运集装箱放在这个具有历史意义的码头上,为零售店入驻提供场地.","    SG Blocks also is working on a project at Pier 57 in New York, where it will slide 456 shipping containers into the historic pier to house retail outlets."
