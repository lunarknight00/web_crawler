"    Facebook的卡洛琳•艾佛森听从了导师雪莉•桑德伯格的建议,将家人从新泽西搬到了伦敦,接受了Facebook国际业务部门的一个职位.","    Facebook's Carolyn Everson followed the advice of Sheryl Sandberg, her mentor, when she moved her family from New Jersey to London and took a job in Facebook's international business that needed filling."
"    艾佛森找到了依靠.而且,在过去六个月内,除了作为Facebook全球营销解决方案副总裁应该承担的职责外,她还一直负责Facebook的欧洲,中东及非洲(EMEA)业务.负责Facebook最重要的广告客户--包括联合利华(Unilever)和可口可乐(Coca-Cola)等<财富>500强公司(Fortune 500),同时还要为欧洲,中东及非洲业务寻找能长久任职的老板,还得照料两个双胞胎女儿,这对艾佛森而言并不轻松.但正如41岁的艾佛森在<财富>最具影响力商界女性大会伦敦站(Fortune Most Powerful Women: London)上所解释的,她得到的回报也是巨大的.在周一的大会上,她面对一百位女性领导人表示,临时在伦敦任职让她学到了很多.","    Everson leaned in. And so, for the past six months, she's been leading Facebook (FB) Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in addition to doing her main job as Facebook's VP of Global Marketing Solutions.Nothing is easy when you're in charge of Facebook's most important ad clients-Fortune 500 companies like Unilever (UL) and Coca-Cola (KO)-while searching for a permanent EMEA boss and caring for young twin daughters. But the payback can be big, as Everson, 41, explained at Fortune Most Powerful Women: London. She told 100 women leaders at our Monday conference that she learned these lessons from temping in London:"
1. 实现品牌人性化.,1. Humanize the brand.
"    艾佛森今年1月份抵达伦敦.她承认:""当时客户对于Facebook品牌的认知令我感到吃惊.客户们会对我说:'你知道嘛,你在演示中所使用的材料,你说起Facebook品牌的方式,一点都不人性化.'""为了改变客户对Facebook的认识,她要求团队改变宣传方式.艾佛森在总结Facebook新的,更人性化的""销售""方式时说:""Facebook上有所有对你重要的人.他们在这里能找到对他们最重要的东西.""此外,她还在""全球客户委员会""的基础上成立了一个英国咨询委员会.加入Facebook两年后,她组建了""全球客户委员会"".提到咨询委员会,艾佛森说:""他们已经成为我们的内部董事会.""成员都是最主要的广告商.她说:""我认为这对于任何行业都是一种非常有趣的模式.每一家公司都有自己的董事会.我认为,每个人也应该有属于自己的个人董事会.""","    When Everson arrived in London in January, ""what I was surprised about was the perception of the Facebook brand,"" she admitted. ""Clients would say to me, 'You know, the materials that you use in your presentations--the way you talk about the brand--it's just not humanizing."" Jumping to fix clients' perceptions of Facebook, she directed her team to alter their pitch. ""Facebook has all of the people that matter to you, where they discover what matters to them,"" says Everson, summing up the new, more human Facebook ""sell."" She also created a UK advisory board, a twist on a ""global client council"" that she assembled after joining Facebook two years ago. ""They have really become our internal board of directors,"" says Everson about the advisory boards. The members are key advertisers. ""I actually think it's an interesting model for all industries,"" she says, adding, ""Every company has their board of directors. I think every person should have their own personal board of directors."""
2. 维护公司的信誉.,2. Safeguard your reputation.
"    许多人指责Facebook允许发布基于性别的仇恨言论,当被问及Facebook如何应对这些指责时,艾佛森说:""我们每天在Facebook收到45亿条内容.""她回忆起在五月份参加宝洁公司(Procter & Gamble)的一次会议时,曾与美国运通公司(American Express)首席营销官约翰•海耶斯有过交流.在那次大会上,有活动分子和广告商向Facebook施压,要求它进行改革.""他把我拽到一边说:'卡洛琳,给你一条建议:人们对品牌的判断基于品牌自身做出的反应.一定记住这一点.比方说,你可以采取前瞻性的措施来应对这些问题,压制住这些仇恨言论,执行严格的政策,让更多人对内容进行审查,以此保护广告商.'""Facebook听从了海耶斯的建议.关于Facebook修改后的有关网络仇恨的指导方针,艾佛森说:""没有人,没有任何一家数字公司能向任何人保证,即将出台的解决方案将会完美无缺.我们正在努力接近这个目标.""","    ""We receive about 4.5 billion pieces of content a day on Facebook,"" Everson said when asked how Facebook handled charges that it allows gender-based hate speech. She recalled being with John Hayes, the chief marketing officer of American Express (AXP), at a Procter & Gamble (PG) conference in May when activists and advertisers pressured Facebook to reform. ""He pulled me aside and said, 'Carolyn, one bit of advice for you: Brands are judged by how they react. Just remember that. If you take every proactive step to fight this, get the content down, put strict policies in place, get more people to actually review the content to protect advertisers.'"" Facebook followed Hayes' advice. ""No one, not one digital company, can guarantee anybody that this is going to be a perfect solution,"" Everson says about Facebook's revised guidelines on cyber-hate. ""We're trying to get darn close."""
3. 互依.,3. Lean in.
"    艾佛森在维亚康姆(Viacom)旗下的MTV电视台(MTV Networks)工作了六年,当她听说谢丽尔•桑德伯格希望聘请她去Facebook时,她已在微软(Microsoft)履新五个月时间.当时,她们两人并不认识.艾佛森告诉<财富>最具影响力商界女性大会的观众们:""我说:'你在开玩笑吧.我可干不了这个.'我考虑了大约30秒钟,然后意识到,我一直都很喜欢Facebook.我在MTV的时候就一直在尝试收购Facebook,所以我可以说是看着Facebook长大的.做出那样的决定真的非常困难.而且有人警告我说,在那里工作将非常动荡不安.结果证明,这是我做过的最好的决定.""","    After six years at Viacom's (VIA) MTV Networks, Everson was five months into a big new job at Microsoft (MSFT) when she got word that Sheryl Sandberg, whom she did not know, wanted to recruit her to Facebook. ""I said, 'You have got to be kidding me. I can't do this.'...I thought about it for maybe 30 seconds and realized that I had always loved Facebook. I had tried to buy Facebook when I was at MTV, so I had been watching the company from the very, very beginning."" Everson told the Fortune MPW audience: ""It was a really tough process to get through that decision. And people warned me that it was going to be tumultuous. But it turned out to be the best decision for me."""
"    本周五,艾佛森将和她的丈夫和两个女儿一起回到美国.是的,她终于找到了接班人.尼克拉•门德尔森成为Facebook欧洲,中东及非洲地区业务的新任副总裁.门德尔森曾在伦敦发展迅速的广告公司Karmarama担任执行总裁,由此也可以看出Facebook的重点依然是广告商.","    This Friday, Everson and her husband and two girls are moving back to the U.S. Yes, she found her replacement. Nicola Mendelsohn, formerly executive chairman at fast-growing London ad agency Karmarama, is Facebook's new VP of the EMEA region--and a clear sign that Facebook's laser focus is on advertisers."
