"    任天堂(Nintendo)的3DS掌上游戏机能否成为一款流行的电子书阅读器?日本最大的印刷公司大日本印刷株式会社(Dai Nippon Printing)认为很有这个可能.大日本印刷是日本出版业巨头,它日前宣布,将在今年秋天为年轻读者推出300本可在任天堂热卖的3DS掌上游戏机上阅读的电子书.","    Can Nintendo's 3DS handheld become a powerhouse e-reader? Japan's biggest printer, Dai Nippon Printing, thinks so. The company, which is a big player in domestic publishing here, announced it will launch 300 titles for young readers this fall for Nintendo's popular portable console."
"
","    Dai Nippon is already selling e-books and manga through conventional e-readers, a crowded market. Manga on all platforms including mobile phones are popular but regular e-books do less well. The publisher says it is particularly keen to go after young readers who, it claims, often don't have access to e-books on any platform. By narrowing their demographic to a gaming-obsessed youth, the firm hopes e-book sales might finally take off. ""We estimated that portable game devices, especially the 3DS, is popular among under twelves in Japan,"" a DNP spokesman says. ""But, there aren't many children that have e-book readers, iPads, and so on, so we started this new business to target them."""
"    大日本印刷目前已经在通过传统电子书阅读器销售电子书和漫画,但这个市场已经相当拥挤.漫画在包括手机在内的所有平台上都颇受欢迎,但普通的电子书就没那么畅销了.身为出版商的大日本印刷表示,特别渴望争取到年轻读者.这家公司声称,年轻读者往往无法通过其它平台看到电子书.通过将这一人群缩小到痴迷游戏的年轻人,大日本印刷希望电子书的销量最终能够出现大的起色.""我们估计便携式游戏设备,特别是任天堂3DS,在日本12岁以下的儿童中很流行,""DNP公司发言人说.""但是,很多孩子都没有电子书阅读器以及iPad等,我们开展此项业务正是瞄准了这个群体.","    Despite a reputation for being early adopters, Japanese consumers haven't fallen for e-readers. Sales of conventional e-books and e-readers have been comparatively poor. E-Reader adoption, well established in other developed nations -- around 25% of U.S. consumers have one -- is low in Japan. With 11 million 3DS units sold so far in Japan, Nintendo's (NTDOY) gadget could be ideal for creating an e-book audience. As there are only about 1 million dedicated e-readers in circulation in Japan, DNP reckons it stands to multiply possible e-book outlets by a factor of ten."
"    虽然日本消费者以喜欢新技术而著称,但电子书在这个国家却未能流行起来.传统电子书的销量堪称惨淡.虽然电子书在许多发达国家相当畅销,例如每四个美国人中就有一人拥有电子书,但唯独日本例外.任天堂3DS目前在日本已售出1,100万部,它或许能够有效地扩大电子书的用户群.目前日本市场的传统电子书存量仅为100万部,大日本印刷预计,日本电子书市场有望扩大10倍.","    ""For Nintendo, e-books are a new business that will not only allow them to diversify their product portfolio and create a new revenue stream but also provide a new marketing angle: It will be now easier to sell the 3DS to parents -- who mainly make the purchasing decision for their kids,"" Tokyo-based technology consultant Serkan Toto says."
"    来自东京的技术顾问Serkan Toto说:""电子书不但能帮助任天堂丰富产品线从而获取更多收益,更重要的是,它会为3DS带来新的市场机遇.任天堂可以更容易地向家长推销3DS,而正是这些人做出决定,购买游戏机给孩子.""","    He agrees potential sales could be massive in one of the most bookish nations in the world. The children's books market in Japan is worth about $790 million annually. Meanwhile, the market for e-books in Japan is expected to triple by 2017 to $2.3 billion, according to analysts at Japan's Impress Business Media Corp."
"    Serkan Toto认可3DS电子书的销量极具潜力,因为日本是世界上阅读氛围最浓厚的国家.来自日本调研公司Impress Business Media Corp的分析师表示,日本儿童图书市场目前市值高达7.9亿美元.预计到2017年,日本电子书市场有望增长两倍,达到23亿美元.","    Some are not so bullish. Critics point to falling readership of books, magazines, and newspapers. Tokyo-based market research firm MM Research Institute reports that e-reader demand was weaker in Japan last year than expected owing to the high price of e-books in Japan, their relative scarcity, and competition with smartphones and tablets. E-reader sales are expected to slow substantially this year."
"    不过,不少分析师对此持怀疑态度.一些人指出,书籍,杂志和报纸的读者数正呈下降趋势.东京的市场调研公司MM Research Institute发布报告称,由于电子书价格高企,种类不足以及来自智能手机和平板电脑的竞争,整个电子书设备市场去年表现疲软,销量未达预期.这家公司预计,今年电子书销量仍然不会出现起色.","    DNP's e-book service for children will be implemented through a freely downloadable e-books app for the 3DS, although a Nintendo spokeswoman denied the console maker is collaborating with DNP on this aspect of the service. Books digitized by DNP will be easily readable on the 3DS's high-resolution touchscreens she said. ""We already distribute brain training and english learning and e-books through our consoles, while Sharp Corp has a program that uses the 3DS at schools in Japan,"" she said."
