"    针对7月3日埃及发生的政变,<财富>杂志(Fortune)采访了埃及风投公司Sawari Ventures常驻华盛顿的合伙人莱斯利•捷普.捷普的丈夫爱德华•沃克尔在1994年至1997年间曾经是美国驻埃及大使.","    With all of the change today in Egypt, Fortune decided to check in with Leslie Jump -- a Washington, D.C.-based partner with Egyptian venture capital firm Sawari Ventures. She also is the wife of Edward Walker, U.S. Ambassador to Egypt between 1994 and 1997."
"
","    We first talked to Jump during the original Tahrir Square protests of 2011, which resulted in the ouster of Hosni Mubarak."
"    我们第一次和捷普对话是2011年开罗解放广场最初举行抗议的时候,抗议最终导致胡斯尼•穆巴拉克下台.","    This evening we wanted her sense on what has happened to Egypt's economy since then, and what today's events mean for the future of Egyptian entrepreneurs. What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation:"
"    7月3日晚上,我们想听听后来埃及经济发生了什么?3日白天发生的事件对于埃及创业者的未来意味着什么?下面是经过编辑整理的访谈录音文字:","    FORTUNE: From an economic perspective, was President Morsi good for Egypt?"
"    <财富>杂志:从经济角度来看,穆尔西总统是否对埃及有益?","    JUMP: No, he was not. There has been a lot of talk today about whether or not this was a coup, but the reality is that while Morsi was democratically-elected, he had been making so many moves to consolidate authority that it was getting closer to a dictatorship."
"    捷普:不,他不利于埃及经济.关于这是不是一场政变现在还有很多说法,但现实是穆尔西虽然是民选总统,却一直在采取很多措施巩固自身权力,越来越接近独裁.","    And that had begun to spread to businesses and the economy, which spooked international investors."
"    而且,这种情况也开始扩散到商界和经济中,让国际投资者感到不安.","    So it has been a pretty rough time over the last couple of years for Egyptians. We're still early in this new process, but the people I work with in Egypt are encouraged by what has happened today."
"    因此,过去这几年,埃及人过得相当艰难.我们仍处在这个新进程的早期,但在埃及,和我共事的人们都很为7月3日埃及发生的事情感到鼓舞.","    Won't international investors continue to be spooked, worried that Egypt will become mired in political instability?"
"    国际投资者不会继续害怕,担心埃及会陷入政治动荡?","    I would argue that today is really a continuation, and hopefully conclusion, to what happened two years ago. I'm not a political expert, but the people who participated in the events of 2011 thought they were moving toward a more open government and thus more open economy. There is hope that the interim regime regains that spirit, by being diversified, transparent and quickly moving through what we'd consider to be proper democratic processes. It's encouraging that standing next to the military today was the head of the Coptic Church, the imam of Cairo's first mosque and Mohamed ElBaradei."
"    我认为,7月3日的事件事实上是过去的延续,也希望它能成为两年前那起事件的终结.我不是政治专家,但参与2011年推翻穆巴拉克抗议示威活动的人们认为,他们正在朝一个方向迈进:更加开放的政府和由此更加开放的经济.希望过渡政府能重树这一精神,实现多元化和透明,迅速进入我们认为适当的民主流程.令人振奋的是,目前与军方站在一起的是卡普兰教会(Coptic Church)的负责人,开罗大清真寺的阿訇和穆罕默德•巴拉迪(2005年诺贝尔和平奖得主).","    Of course, one group wasn't represented..."
"    当然,有一个团体没有代表......","    The Brotherhood? One thing people in Egypt really were worked up about was the government, by which I basically mean the Brotherhood, interfering in their daily life. A lot of people, including Muslims who don't happen to be far right-wingers, found what they were doing to be highly offensive."
