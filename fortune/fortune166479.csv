"    我的父亲是第二代移民,连高中都没毕业,辛辛苦苦干了50多年的酒保.我母亲也是第二代移民,她这辈子就只顾着在家带孩子了.他们俩总是要求我上最好的学校,比别人用功,追求自己的梦想--对我来说这就是30多年前来到硅谷追梦.听起来可能很老套,但事实就是如此.如果努力工作,追求梦想,一切皆有可能.","    My father was a second-generation immigrant who didn't graduate from high school. He worked extremely hard for 50+ years as a bartender while my mother, also a second-generation immigrant, raised the kids. They both always demanded that I get the best education possible, work harder than anyone else and then pursue my dreams-which for me was coming to Silicon Valley over 30+ years ago. Although it may sound trite, it's the truth. Anything is possible if you work hard and pursue your dreams."

And if I wasn't working at Jive, in addition to sitting on the board, I would spend as much time as I could on the golf course or ski slopes."
