"    从某种程度上看,谷歌(Google)Reader之死仿佛打开了一个魔盒:一款RSS阅读器倒下了,无数款RSS阅读器站起来--包括Feedly,AOL Reader,Digg Reader等等.","    In some ways, it seems like the death of Google Reader unleashed a hydra -- destroy one RSS reader, and several pop up in its place: namely Feedly, AOL Reader and Digg Reader, among others."
"    我的同事雷恩•布拉德利指出,谷歌Reader的社交元素是它最吸引人的特点之一.谷歌关闭Reader的分享特色,把它并入社交平台Google+之际,它也就扼杀了自己赖以吸引许多核心用户的社交元素.当我仍然怀念谷歌Reader的分享和社交元素(也一定会尝试Potluck)时,我也知道Twitter,Facebook,Tumblr和所谓的""隐性社交""平台,如电子邮件和聊天软件,可以一解""交流之痒"".RSS野草萌发的真正原因在于它的时间迁移功能.","    As my colleague Ryan Bradley points out, the social aspect of Google Reader was one its most appealing parts. When Google (GOOG) shuttered the sharing features of Reader and migrated them to Google+, it killed off the community aspect, which appealed to many of its core users. And while I still miss the sharing and social aspect of Google Reader (and will definitely try Potluck), I know that Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and so-called ""dark social"" platforms like email and chat can scratch that communicative itch. The real reason that the RSS hydra is sprouting is because of time shifting."
"    对于信息狂人,或者说任何曾经需要靠博客日志为生的人来说,RSS阅读器是无价之宝.Twitter的运作方式是纯流量:一小时不看,你就会错过大量信息,想要梳理这些信息完全是徒劳.而RSS则允许人们暂时离开,回来后仍然能够继续浏览到信息.当然,用户有时候也会宣布""RSS破产"",同时将阅读器中1,000条以上的未读条目标记为""已读"".不过在很大程度上,人们可以赶上每天的新闻,浏览标题,更加从容地开始阅读.","    For information junkies -- or anyone who has ever had to make a living blogging -- RSS readers are invaluable. Twitter operates as pure flow: miss an hour, and you're going to miss a lot, and trying to comb through the archives is an exercise in futility. RSS allows for someone to step away, come back and browse. Sure, there are times when users have to declare ""RSS bankruptcy"" and mark the 1000+ unread items in his or reader as read without combing through, but for the most part someone can catch up on the day's news, skim headlines and read at a more leisurely pace."
"    此外,RSS还有个好处,就是""从不忘记""发布的内容.如果有人在博客上发布了一些信息,之后又删除了,被删除的内容常会留在RSS中.一旦有信息发布在网上,就永远在网上了.所以对这些继续谷歌Reader未竟之业的公司,我要献上赞美之词.我选择的替代品是Feedly,因为老实说,我真讨厌改变""我的网络"",而Feedly的""只看标题""界面完美模仿了谷歌Reader.我能轻松导入订阅信息,而移动设备的版本也做得很棒.","    Plus, there's the bonus of RSS tending to ""never forget"" a post. If someone posted something on a blog and later deletes, frequently the deleted piece stays in RSS, another reminder that once something hits the Internet, it's there forever. So I celebrate these companies picking up where Google Reader left off. My replacement of choice is Feedly, because if I'm being honest, I really hate change to ""my Internet,"" and the Feedly ""Titles Only"" view mimics Google Reader perfectly. It was easy to import my feeds, and the mobile versions are great."
"    现在,我可以开始日常工作,一边咒骂发布视频而不在后面附带上说明文字的网页,一边迅速高效地浏览大量信息.就像我说的,我真地讨厌互联网的变化.","    Now I can go about my usual business of skimming tons of information quickly and efficiently while cursing when a site only posts a video without descriptive text underneath. Like I said, I really hate Internet change."
