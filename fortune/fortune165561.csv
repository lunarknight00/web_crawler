"    经过数周的申请,面试和等待,当申请人收到一纸苍白空洞的拒绝函时,结果会怎样?","    What's an applicant to do when, after weeks of applying, interviewing, and waiting, he receives a flimsy boilerplate rejection letter?"
"    如果完全不给他们任何反馈,不解释为什么他们不够格,这些一腔热情的求职者未来可能还是很难找到工作.但是,由于法律禁止歧视求职者,招聘者常常三缄其口.这也是密歇根招聘公司Qualigence的创始人兼CEO史蒂夫•鲁伊兹从应聘者那里听到最多的抱怨.虽然大多数应聘者都愿意接受一些坦诚但却富有建设性的批评,但一家旨在改善招聘行为的非营利组织Talent Board最近进行的一项研究显示,超过2,000名受访者中只有4.4%的人收到过招聘经理和招聘人员的具体反馈.","    Without the help of feedback explaining why they didn't rate, future positions may prove elusive for such eager applicants. Yet, because of laws that protect applicants from discrimination, employers' tongues are tied. It's the No. 1 complaint Steve Lowisz hears from candidates as founder and CEO of Michigan-based recruitment firm Qualigence. Though most applicants would appreciate some candid and constructive criticism, a recent study by the Talent Board, a nonprofit that works to improve recruiting practices, indicates that only 4.4% of more than 2,000 participants received specific feedback from hiring managers and recruiters."
"    鲁伊兹表示,沉默不一定是因为担心吃官司.很多时候是因为懒惰.许多公司使用内部招聘系统的标准模板来发送回绝信.","    Radio silence doesn't only have to do with lawsuit worries, Lowisz says. It has plenty do with laziness. Many companies rely on standard jargon generated by their applicant tracking system for the so-called Dear John letter."
"    但保持沉默也可能导致招聘公司错失机会.开诚布公的沟通有助于建立和维护与求职者的关系,不排除有些求职者可能会在将来被录用.即便他们永远不会成为公司员工,求职者也会记得那位曾经花了些时间提供帮助的经理.被拒的求职者也可能会推荐其它合格候选人,或者成为一位忠实的客户.","    Staying mum could also lead to a missed opportunity for the hiring company. Open communication can help build and maintain relationships with candidates who could be recruited in the future. Even if they never become part of the staff, applicants will remember the manager who took the time to do a bit more to help. A rejected applicant might even refer other qualified candidates or become a loyal customer."
"    虽然律师不建议为被拒求职者提供招聘反馈,但律师事务所合伙人约瑟夫•哈瑞斯表示,如果你打算提供反馈,就应该围绕招聘职位的主要职能及核心要求来进行.这样做或许能帮助求职者在未来的申请和面试中更好地表现自己.","    Although giving feedback to rejected job applicants is not a practice employment lawyers would recommend, Joseph Harris, a partner at law firm White Harris says if you are going to do it, focus on the essential functions of the job and its core requirements. This could help candidates with future applications and interviews."
"    当然,有些事绝不能提.气场不足,与面试者不投缘,或者面试者的父母应该已经提前扼杀在萌芽状态的其他不当行为都应该绝口不提.","    There are, of course, some things that shouldn't be mentioned at all. Lack of charisma or chemistry with the interviewing team, as well as other unsavory behaviors that the applicant's parents should have nipped in the bud shouldn't be brought up."
"    明尼阿波利斯Nilan Johnson Lewis的就业律师马克•吉拉德表示,应该避免对求职者的着装或外貌品头论足.对于求职者发型或服装选择的无心点评可能会遭到误解,将求职者划入一个受保护的弱势群体.","    Avoid comments about a candidate's dress or appearance, says Mark Girouard, an employment attorney at Nilan Johnson Lewis in Minneapolis. What might seem like an innocent comment about a hairstyle or outfit choice could be misperceived as a reference to the applicant's membership in a protected class."
