"    据两家调查公司的报告显示,中国公司联想(Lenovo)终于不负众望,在上周成为全球最大的个人电脑供应商.高德纳(Gartner)与国际数据公司(IDC)均表示,2013年第二季度,联想的市场份额达到了16.7%.高德纳称,联想终于取代了一直占据市场首位的惠普(Hewlett Packard).惠普的市场份额则下跌到了16.3%.","    As widely expected, China's Lenovo this week emerged as the world's top purveyor of personal computers, according to new reports from two research firms. Both Gartner and IDCsay Lenovo's market share in the second quarter of 2013 hit 16.7%. Lenovo unseats longtime No. 1, Hewlett Packard, whose share fell to 16.3%, Gartner says."
"    除此之外,联想还有一件事值得庆祝:在今年的<财富>世界500强( Fortune Global 500)排名中,联想上升了41位,排名第329位.今年进入世界500强排行榜的中国大陆公司共有89家.","    Lenovo had another reason to celebrate this week: The company climbed 41 spots to No. 329 on the Fortune Global 500, Fortune's ranking of the world'd largest corporations. Lenovo is one of 89 Chinese Mainland-based companies on the list."
"    尽管联想的市场份额在扩大,但全球PC业的发展却在持续放缓.IDC和高德纳的调查均显示,第二季度全球PC出货量持续下降(分别为11.4%和10.9%).实际上,联想的计算机总体出货量同样出现了小幅下降,但由于惠普,戴尔(Dell),尤其是宏碁(Acer)和华硕(Asus)等各大竞争对手出货量下降幅度更大,因此,联想的总体市场份额反而有所增加--当前季度达到7,560万台.","    Lenovo's share gains come amid a slowdown in the global PC business. IDC and Gartner show continued declines in second-quarter shipments (11.4% and 10.9%, respectively). Indeed, Lenovo's total shipment of computers fell slightly, but because rivals such as HP (HPQ), Dell (DELL), and especially Acer and Asus, saw even greater declines. Lenovo's share of the overall market -- 75.6 million units in the quarter -- edged up."
"    整个行业的困境并没有影响到联想CEO杨元庆的信心.最近在成都举办的<财富>全球论坛上,杨元庆强调了联想征服其他领域的必要性.他说:""我们的战略是不仅做一家PC厂商,我们还要进军PC+市场.所以我们必须在平板设备和智能手机领域有所斩获.""","    The industry's struggles are not lost on Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang. During a panel at the recent Fortune Global Forum in Chengdu, Yang underscored the need for Lenovo to conquer other categories. ""We set a strategy to become not just a PC player, but also a PC-plus player. So we must win in the tablet area, in the smart phone area,"" he said."
"    但联想与惠普不同,惠普对于个人电脑的投入已经有所动摇(还记得吗,惠普曾经认真考虑退出个人电脑业,但最终还是放弃了?),但联想却依然对这个领域充满信心.杨元庆接受<财富>杂志高级记者米格尔•赫尔夫特采访时说:""个人计算机绝对不会消亡.""","    But unlike HP, which has sometimes wavered in its commitment to personal computers (remember when HP mulled, then reversed, a plan to exit the business? ) Lenovo continues to be a big believer in the category. Yang told Fortune senior writer Miguel Helft: The ""PC definitely will not die."""
"    联想与世界500强中其他中国公司的不同之处在于它收入的多元化.许多中国国企几乎完全依赖国内销售.而联想和电信设备制造商华为(Huawei,财富世界500强排名第315位)这两家民营企业却成功将其产品推广到了全世界.例如,在印度,消费者考虑购买PC时,选择最多的就是联想品牌.","    What sets Lenovo apart from the other Chinese companies on the Global 500 ranking is the diversity of its revenue. Many Chinese state-owned enterprises rely almost entirely on domestic sales. Lenovo and telecom equipment maker Huawei (No. 315), are private companies, and they successfully sell their products around the world. The Lenovo brand is the top choice among Indian consumers considering a PC purchase, for example."
"    当然,中国依然是对联想及其竞争对手非常重要的市场.上个月,惠普宣布对管理层进行大规模调整.公司CEO梅格•惠特曼将一直担任PC部门主管的托德•布拉德利调任到新的战略岗位.公司表示,布拉德利将负责加强惠普在中国的业务.","    China, of course, remains an important market for Lenovo -- and its competitors. Last month HP announced a big management reorganization. CEO Meg Whitman reassigned longtime PC chief Todd Bradley to a new strategy role. The company specified that he is responsible for enhancing HP's business in China."
