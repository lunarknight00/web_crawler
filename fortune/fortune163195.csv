Each week, Fortune will turn the spotlight on a different conference attendee to offer his or her own personal insight into business, tech, and entrepreneurship. This week, we asked Hearsay Social founder and CEO Clara Shihto answer 10 questions about life outside of work, the company she admires most, and industry advice for young entrepreneurs. Her responses follow:"
    你获得过的最好建议是什么?,    What is the best advice you ever received?
"    我获得过的最好建议来自我的导师克雷格•威勒普,他说,""头脑,心灵和双手""是领导力的关键,这指的是非常重要的三方面:分析数据和事实要客观,领导要有激情和意志,做事要捋起袖子和同事并肩奋战.","    The best advice I ever received is from my mentor Craig Weatherup, who says ""head, heart, and hands"" are the keys to leadership, referring to the importance of all three: analyzing objective data and facts, leading with passion and purpose, and rolling up your sleeves and being in the trenches with your people."
"    当前就业市场非常严峻,对于即将进入这个市场的年轻人,你想说些什么?",    What would you say to a group of young people looking to enter the tough job market?
"    别害怕,保持昂扬的斗志,关注机会.不要碍于虚荣或薪酬,从底层做起,一步一个脚印,走出自己的路.最重要的是,要找到那些能激励你,值得你学习的人,然后疯狂工作,不要让他们(或者你自己)失望.","    Be fearless, scrappy, and opportunistic. Don't let ego or entitlement prevent you from starting at the bottom, working your way up, and carving your own path. Above all, find people who inspire you and who you can learn from, then work like crazy to not let them (or yourself!) down."
"    如果你不做现在的工作,会做什么?",    What would you do if you weren't working at your current job?
    我想象不出我还能做其他什么.,    I couldn't imagine doing anything else!
    你错过的最佳机会是什么?,    What was your biggest missed opportunity?
"    Hearsay Social刚成立几个月时,我和共同创始人史蒂夫(•加利蒂)差一点就成功聘用的一个人,但在最后一刻双方都退缩了.我一直很遗憾,希望将来某一天能和他一起工作.","    There is someone my co-founder Steve [Garrity] and I very nearly hired when Hearsay Social was just a few months old, but in the eleventh hour both sides got cold feet. I have always regretted that this didn't work out and hope to work with him someday."
"    如果有机会,您会创立哪一家初创企业?",    What is one startup you would have wanted to found?
"    Rent the Runway--这家公司太酷了!它们出租设计师服装--包括从纽约设计师凯特•丝蓓到著名华裔女设计师王薇薇等大牌设计师的作品--这些售价动辄成百上千美元的服装以更平价的价格出租,让更多女性能身着漂亮独特的服装出席具特别有意义的活动.","    Rent the Runway -- such a cool company! They rent designer dresses -- from big names like Kate Spade New York to Vera Wang -- that normally retail for hundreds of dollars at a more affordable price, allowing more women to wear a beautiful, unique dress to very special events."
