    你最近阅读了哪些书?,    What was the last book you read?
"    我最近读了三本书:<杰克•韦尔奇自传>(Jack: Straight from the Gut,史诗般的传记),<柔道策略>(Judo Strategy,如何击败竞争对手),<终极企业家>(The Ultimate Entrepreneur ,关于击败竞争对手的传奇故事).","    My three most recent books are: Jack: Straight from the Gut (epic stories), Judo Strategy (how to kill the competition), The Ultimate Entrepreneur (epic stories on killing the competition)."
"    当前的就业市场非常严峻,对那些正在找工作的年轻人,你想说些什么?",    What would you say to a group of young people looking to enter the tough job market?
"    现在是创业的最佳时期,有大把的机会在等着你们.各行各业都面临着来自新技术和新服务的巨大冲击,后者以更直接,更简单的方式为客户带来更高的价值.如果创业不行,来我们公司应聘吧,我们在招人.","    Now is as good a time as any to start a company, and there's an infinite amount of opportunity in the world today. Every product category is facing significant disruption by new technologies and services that bring better value to customers through more direct and simplified approaches. And if that doesn't work out, we're hiring."
"    如果不做现在的工作,你会做什么?",    What would you do if you weren't working at your current job?
"    我也许会从事3D打印,或许还会尝试利用科技改变破烂不堪的医疗系统,最后,我可能会暂时呆在爸妈的地下室里.","    Doing something with 3-D printing, attempting to change our broken health care system using technology, or living in my parents' basement."
    你错过的最佳机会是什么?,    What was your biggest missed opportunity?
"    科技界最棒的一点是,每隔几年就一定会出现新的机遇.如果你发现了什么大的机遇,机会之门最多在几年之后就会关闭:而如果你不幸错过了什么好机会,永远还有希望赶上下一波.我们要做的就是不断地自我调整,以免错过任何大好机会.","    The great thing about the technology market is new opportunities show up every couple of years, like clockwork. When you hit on something big, it only lasts for a couple of years max; and if you miss something big, you can always catch the next wave. Your job is to always be recorrecting so no opportunity is ever fully missed."
    你从学校学到的最重要的东西是什么?,    What was the most important thing you learned in school?
"    学校太后知后觉了.我们大部分时间都在学习过去发生了什么,而很少花时间学习如何开创未来.结果导致学生们只会死记硬背,严重缺乏创新和变革世界的能力.我们的经济每过10年就会大变样,我们必须给学生更好的教育和训练,让他们能适应变化.","    How backwards school is. We spend most of our time learning about what happened in the past, but so little time is spent teaching students how to build the future. This leads to people being great at rote memorization, but ill-prepared for creating progress and change in the world. We need to do a way better job at educating and training students for how drastically different our economy will look in just 10 years."
