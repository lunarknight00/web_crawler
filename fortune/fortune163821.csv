"    随着就业市场好转,找到和培养人才变得更加关键.具体可以按下面5个步骤执行.","    As hiring picks up, discovering and nurturing talent is ever more crucial. Here's how to do it:"
    1. 钓简历,    1. Seed the résumé pile
"    为了与Facebook和苹果(Apple)等庞然大物争抢优秀人才,在大学招聘会上,仅有150名员工的科技公司Inflection 采用了一种非常难对付的游击营销策略来吸引最优秀的求职者.这家公司让来自名牌大学的员工分发""幸运13""临时纹身--意思是说公司将在2013年聘用13人.结果:这家来自加州红木海岸的公司收到了1,500份求职申请,其中包括来自斯坦福大学(Stanford)和麻省理工(MIT)等名牌院校的高材生.","    Vying for top talent against the likes of Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500), 150-employee tech firm Inflection uses a sticky guerrilla-marketing technique to attract the best candidates at college career fairs. It had staffers from elite schools hand out ""Lucky 13"" temporary tattoos -- built around the theme that it would hire 13 people in 2013. Result: The Redwood Shores, Calif., company got 1,500 applicants from schools like Stanford and MIT."
    2. 以文化契合度为标准,    2. Sort for cultural fit
"    建筑咨询公司Little in Charlotte的初级岗位通常会有数百名追求者.为了找出能够在""有趣,开放,协作的文化""中成长的合适人选,公司全国工程总监杰夫•罗曼会挑选出有过社区工作经历或在兄弟会,运动队中担任过领导角色的人选.展示陈述是这家公司工作的一个重要部分,因此他说:""你必须具备和其他人交谈的能力.""","    Architectural consulting firm Little in Charlotte often gets hundreds of aspirants for entry-level positions. To find people who will thrive in the ""fun, open, collaborative culture,"" Jeff Roman, national director of engineering, scours résumés for signs of community involvement and leadership roles in fraternities or on sports teams. Since presenting is part of life at the firm, he says, ""you need to be able to talk to people."""
    3. 用独特的视角看待过去的成就,    3. Look creatively at past results
"    我们很难评估没有全职工作经验的年轻人,所以我们应该从其他角度来评估他们的能力.在仅有十人的翻译公司Choice Translating,公司首席运营官弗农•梅纳德发现,做过自由职业的年轻应聘者习惯了在一个项目结束后领取薪酬,这一点非常适合他的虚拟公司.他说:""团队里的每一名成员都必须能够自我管理.""","    It's hard to evaluate young people who may not have any full-time work histories, so look for other signs they can get things done. Vernon Menard, COO of Choice Translating, a 10-person firm, has found that young hires who have done some freelancing -- and are used to getting paid only when they complete a project -- have been great fits for his virtual company. ""Everyone on the team must be self-managing,"" he says."
    4. 提高价码,    4. Up the ante
"    笔者知道的一家美国中西部的公司会送给新员工意外的惊喜.当时他正准备前往一个不太吸引年轻人的城市,工作两到三年时间.就在搬家之前,公司主动给他加薪10,000美元.因为他最初的工资已经非常体面,公司一个小小的举动给他留下了深刻印象--他开始迫切希望证明,公司为他花的每一分钱都物超所值.我猜,他待在那家公司的时间肯定不止三年.","    One Midwestern company I know surprised a new hire with a $10,000 raise shortly before he relocated for a two- to three-year gig in a city that is not usually a big draw for young people. Since he was already getting a decent salary, that small gesture made a big impression -- and he started out eager to prove he was worth every penny the firm was paying him. My guess is he'll stay longer than three years."
    5. 配备导师,    5. Provide a mentor
"    这一代年轻人渴求进步.如果公司能为他们提供一名顾问,帮助他们进步,肯定更能吸引到那些最出色,最有才华的年轻人.Inflection公司会安排一名前一年入职的合适员工,为新员工提供12个月的辅导.公司CEO马修•莫纳汉说:""刚走出大学校门的年轻人都希望能尽可能多地学习.""他肯定深有体会:他自己也才29岁.","    This generation is hungry to advance. Your company will be more attractive to the best and the brightest if you offer them an adviser who can help them do that. Inflection provides every new hire with 12 months of mentorship from an appropriate staffer who had been hired at the firm the previous year. ""People straight out of college want to learn as much as they can,"" says CEO Matthew Monahan. He should know: He is 29."
